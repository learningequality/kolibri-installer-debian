# Configuring Kolibri

Kolibri can either be run manually or be controlled through the system service
interface.

The local kolibri instance can be configured using the `options.ini` config
file, located at `$KOLIBRI_HOME/options.ini`. By default, `$KOLIBRI_HOME` is
`~/.kolibri`. For more information, see:

  https://kolibri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manage/advanced.html

If you are unsure which `$KOLIBRI_HOME` is defined for your Kolibri instance,
this command will print it:

  `sudo su -l cat /etc/kolibri/username -c "source /etc/default/kolibri && kolibri manage shell -c 'import os; print(\"KOLIBRI_HOME is: {}\".format(os.environ[\"KOLIBRI_HOME\"]))'"`

You can also configure Kolibri using environment variables rather than `options.ini`.
Any option from this file can be used by prefixing the option name with "`KOLIBRI_`".
For example, `HTTP_PORT` can be configured as

  `KOLIBRI_HTTP_PORT=1234 kolibri start`





# Controlling kolibri through the system service interface

This Debian package allows running Kolibri as a system service containing the 
runtime instance. The runtime process and its data is owned by a defined user
account. The name of this user account is configured in `/etc/kolibri/username`.

  ## systemd (default on Ubuntu 16.04+ and Debian Jessie, Stretch, Buster+)
`sudo systemctl start/stop/restart kolibri` 

`sudo systemctl enable/disable kolibri`

  ## sys-v-init (Other systems, Devuan)
  `sudo service kolibri start/stop/restart`





*In case kolibri is controlled through the system service interface, other 
configurations are also possible, but notice that with the common adoption of 
systemd , the rest of the configurations mentioned in this document are 
considered deprecated and are being kept only to maintain backwards 
compatibility with previous installations.*

*In case of a new installation, consider using only environment variables or 
the `$KOLIBRI_HOME/options.ini` file mentioned in the previous section.*

## Configuring the system service

If you would like to change the location of `$KOLIBRI_HOME`, you can add a file
`/etc/kolibri/conf.d/kolibri_home.conf` with the contents:

  KOLIBRI_HOME=/location/of/your/choice

Tip: If you only want to change where content is stored, you can do that
using the Kolibri `movedirectory` command:

  ### Remember to change to the configured system service user account firstly
  `su -l cat /etc/kolibri/username`

  #### Move current content folder to <destination>
  `kolibri manage content movedirectory <destination>`

You can also configure Kolibri using variables added to `conf.d` files by 
prefixing the option name with "KOLIBRI_". 
For example, `HTTP_PORT` can be configured as

  `KOLIBRI_HTTP_PORT=1234`

Files in `/etc/kolibri/conf.d/<filename>.conf` will be loaded in alphabetical
order. For more examples, see the file `/etc/kolibri/daemon.conf`.

The `/etc/kolibri/daemon.conf` configuration file is the final one that will be
loaded.

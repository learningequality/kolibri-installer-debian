# Kolibri installer source for Debian

To install and subscribe to updates for Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian, visit our PPA:

[https://launchpad.net/~learningequality/+archive/ubuntu/kolibri](https://launchpad.net/~learningequality/+archive/ubuntu/kolibri)

## Development roadmap

Decisions (some pending):

* This is Python 3.
* All dependencies are bundled.
* `python3-cryptography` is a suggested dependency
* How do we get rid of bundled c-extensions upstream (in Python pkg) and replace them with real dependencies

## Installation instructions

Full installation instructions:

## Building

Either kind of build needs a kolibri tar file. These can be found as an asset in Kolibri releases on Github. Find the URL for the asset and then use the following command to download it:
```
make get-tar tar=<tar-asset-url>
```

### Building a binary

To build the binary (Debian file), first install required dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y devscripts debhelper dh-python python3-all python3-pytest po-debconf python3-setuptools python3-pip build-essential
```

Then run:
```
make kolibri.deb
```

This will build the debian file into the `dist` folder.

### Building sources

This is primarily used to build sources for uploading to launchpad to release to the PPA.
Install required dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y devscripts debhelper python3-pip dput dh-python python3-all python3-pytest
```

Ensure that you have registered your GPG key with your launchpad account and that you are authorized to release to the kolibri-proposed PPA.

To build and upload the package run this command:
```
GPG_PASSPHRASE="<passphrase for your GPG key>" make commit-new-release
```

To just build the signed sources run this command:
```
GPG_PASSPHRASE="<passphrase for your GPG key>" make kolibri.changes
```

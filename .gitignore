# This is by benjaoming's convention the directory to use when dev'ing locally
build/
# The location of the kolibri .tar.gz we're building against.
# Make recipes depend on this, and will download from PyPi if empty.
build_src/
# The location of built .deb, whether built locally or with docker;
# Docker copies the .deb over from its container to this directory.
# Also the bound directory for `docker-test` target.
